== Description ==

Add [desktoponly] or [mobileonly] shortcodes to a Page or Post to restrict access by device type with redirects.

This plugin build came about as an enhancement to this popular snippet: https://gist.github.com/sucreations/7a7ee5e241a54a0bdfc4#file-mobileonly-php
in conjuction with OpenAi's ChatGPT for a use case developed for LogicWizards.one. I've decided to make this an open source project aside from the original 
use case as this tool could become useful for other WordPress sites.

For more perspective on our build, see the video to review our prompt engineering via ChatGPT:
